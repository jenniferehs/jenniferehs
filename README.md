## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Information Technology while working for a non-profit as a Solutions Delivery Specialist. 

I work across multiple systems including Salesforce, Marketing Cloud, Formstack, Surveymonkey...

I'm keen to learn web development and software development skills to complement my current job.
